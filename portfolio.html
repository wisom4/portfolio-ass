        <h2>About Meüëå‚ù§Ô∏è</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Wisdom Awoke. I‚Äôm a Computer Science student with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and innovation. Alongside my academic journey, I‚Äôve gained hands-on experience in business operations and client relations through my role as Sales Manager at Rhoda Froid Workshop.

At Rhoda Froid, I‚Äôve led customer engagement, managed product sales, and coordinated with workshop teams to ensure quality service delivery. This experience sharpened my communication, leadership, and data handling skills ‚Äî and gave me real-world insight into how technology can streamline operations and improve decision-making in business settings.

Combining my technical training with business experience, I‚Äôm especially interested in using computing solutions to improve sales processes, data analysis, and customer experiences. Whether it‚Äôs building a better system, automating workflows, or analyzing user data, I want my work in tech to solve practical problems and create value.

I‚Äôm constantly learning and eager to grow ‚Äî both as a developer and as a strategic thinker. I'm currently exploring areas such as web development, software engineering, and data analytics, and I look forward to applying these skills in real-world projects that make an impact.
        </p>

        <h3>Interest</h3>
        <p>
            I‚Äôm deeply interested in the intersection of creativity and problem-solving. Whether through design, storytelling, or technology, I‚Äôm always drawn to work that challenges me to think differently and make something meaningful.

One of my key passions is [insert your field‚Äîe.g., graphic design, creative writing, software development], where I enjoy the process of turning ideas into tangible, functional outcomes. I‚Äôm particularly inspired by projects that have a real-world impact‚Äîones that improve user experience, tell a compelling story, or bring communities together.

Beyond my professional focus, I‚Äôm also interested in continuous learning. I regularly explore new tools, trends, and techniques to expand my skill set and stay current in a fast-evolving industry. Whether I‚Äôm diving into a new coding language, analyzing design trends, or experimenting with personal projects, I‚Äôm driven by curiosity and a desire to grow.

These interests not only shape the work I do but also the way I approach collaboration, feedback, and innovation.
